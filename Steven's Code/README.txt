Hello everybody.
#git test line
Main files are:
----------------------------
MainTest.m
twitch.m
----------------------------

All you need to do is run MainTest.m
It  might take a little while to start up as it connects to the arduino and yes you
will need the arduino. If you are not connected then the program will not run. If you
want to see something move without the arduino go study up on Ilya's simulated version.
The arm will set itself up by sweeping a little and centering itself then ask you for
input coordinates. Currently there are problems with maintaining speed and oscillations
as we approach the final target, but it adequately demonstrates the ability to perform
linear motion using our small arm. Check it out, email me if there are any problems.

Bugs
----------------------------
Maintaining constant speed of traveling point
Oscillation when approaching final destination
